# ðŸš¦ Traffic Flow Optimizer

A Python simulation of traffic flow at intersections, using Pandas and NumPy to optimize signal timings based on traffic volume.

## Features
- Simulated traffic data generator
- Optimization logic for signal timing
- Parallel simulation of multiple intersections
- Data analysis and visualization using Pandas

## Future Work
- Integrate RL agent to learn adaptive control
- Real-time dashboard with Streamlit
# Traffic-Flow-Optimizer
